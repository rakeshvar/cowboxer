cowboxer

If you want to build static linked cowboxer on Windows first you must 
recompile QT4 for static linking. See details on:
http://www.formortals.com/build-qt-static-small-microsoft-intel-gcc-compiler/

WARNING: translation is not part of static linked application.

If you are satisfied with dynamic linked QT4 (libraries are present in 
win32 folder), than you need to comment/remove line:
    CONFIG += static
in win32 section of CowBoxer.pro

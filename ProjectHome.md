# Introduction #

Cowboxer is a boxing software tool for tesseract OCR.
It is an improvement and customization of the existing [owlboxer](http://code.google.com/p/owlboxer).

Cowboxer can handle string inputs to the 'character'. In many complex scripts a single image is composed of many characters. For Eg:- stri is the single image స్త్రీ in Telugu.

It has additional features like inserting/deleting ONLY a box/string so that the relative assignment of boxes to strings is shifted up or down.

Special thanks to Alexy of the original Owlboxer.
